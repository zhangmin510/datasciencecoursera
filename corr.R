# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a 
# threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation 
# between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the 
# number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is 
# greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector 
# of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
# If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function 
# should return a numeric vector of length 0. 
# For this function you will need to use the 'cor' function in R 
# which calculates the correlation between two vectors.

corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the location of the CSV files
  
  ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
  ## number of completely observed observations (on all
  ## variables) required to compute the correlation between
  ## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0
  
  ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
